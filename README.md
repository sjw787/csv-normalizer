# CSV-Normalizer
CSV Normalizer makes it easy to normalize your CSV files! 
CSV Normalizer uses only the python standard library, so it can be used wherever Python 3.7 and up can! 

## Installation
1. Make sure you are using Python 3.7+ (visit: https://www.python.org/downloads for the latest downloads!)
2. Clone or download this repository 

## Usage (bash)
1. Run this command - `python <install-location>/csv-normalizer/app/normalizer.py path/to/input/file.csv path/to/output/file.csv`

If you don't have a CSV handy, you can run this command with included test data:
`python <install-location>/csv-normalizer/app/normalizer.py <install-location>/csv-normalizer/test/data/sample.csv output.csv`
